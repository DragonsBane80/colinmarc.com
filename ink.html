    <h2>She Must Accept Some Swirling Ink</h2>
    <em>May 2010</em>

    <p>Before the caustic brute she cowers. <br />
    It shudders with stone and towers. <br />
    She's plain; Her simple orbs observe <br />
    horizons as flat, and fervor <br />
    as unbecoming. She is fear, <br />
    a place to hide as it grows near.  </p>

    <p>she cowers Yet, for the beast roils <br />
    with flame and frozen spilled dreams' spoils <br />
    with mares of night, and ocean night. <br />
    It's stronger in its chaos - flight <br />
    not possibile. Before and since <br />
    it lies, both dawn and dusk a fence.  </p>

    <p>Her eyes must drink it to survive, <br />
    she must stop stalling, and arrive. <br />
    She must accept some swirling ink <br />
    into her milk, and sigh, and drink.  </p>
